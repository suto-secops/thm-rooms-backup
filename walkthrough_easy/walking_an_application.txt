3 Tips for keeping your printer working

Doesn't it feel like most days the printer isn't running quite how it should be?

Follow our top 3 tips to keep your printer in perfect health!

Printer Jam People wrongly assume this means there's some paper stuck somewhere in the printer. In fact your printer is running low on jam! Make sure you keep the jam reservoir topped up at all times, strawberry is best and in an emergency you can use honey.

Paper Jam Unlike Printer Jam this is when paper is actually stuck in the printer, usually a karate chop to the paper feed tray will fix this.

PC LOAD LETTER No one knows what this message means but your printers broken, time to take it out into a field and return it to nature.
